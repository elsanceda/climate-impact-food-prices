# Analysis of Climate Impact on Food Prices in Metro Manila

This project aims to analyze the effects of the weather and climate on the food prices in Metro Manila. A linear regression model was used to predict the food prices, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine how much each climate variable affected the price.

This serves as the capstone project for the CS 138 (Elementary Numerical Computing II) course of the Department of Computer Science in the University of the Philippines - Diliman during the first semester of AY 2023-2024.
